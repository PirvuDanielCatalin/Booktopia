# Booktopia---CRUD-Web-App

I created using PHP mapped using the Laravel framework the application management of an online store.
It has an authentication system and a system for managing user roles.
After authentication, depending on the type of user type, he can use certain features of the application.
The simple user can view the products in the store, the details of each product, can manage their own comments and ratings.
The administrator has full access to the content in the app. From the control panel, he can choose to do all kinds of CRUD actions on store's products, view dynamically created statistics, or change user roles. It can also act on the reviews and rating provided by each user.
